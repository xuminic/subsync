1
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,640
Linna, let's go!

2
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,840
So, this is Tokyo?

3
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,160
Linna!

4
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,800
All right!

5
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,280
If you're late, the acting supervisor
will make a big deal out of it.

6
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,600
So it would be a good idea to sneak in.

7
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,240
You don't need to take tea to the
salespeople when they aren't here.

8
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,680
I used to see this city on TV, but it's
even more incredible in person.

9
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,880
It's only been six years since
the earthquake,

10
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,520
but the city's revived and grown
so huge, so fast!

11
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,520
Excuse me!

12
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,200
No, it is I who am sorry.

13
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,360
Oh, sorry.

14
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,880
You don't need to apologize to a boomer
even if you are a new employee.

15
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,640
But weren't the boomers the power
behind the reconstruction?

16
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,280
I've never seen one close up like that!

17
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,120
Oh no! We've got to go buy our lunch!

18
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,680
Wait! How can you tell?

19
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,480
From the shadow.

20
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,480
Under the auspices of the
Genom Corporation,

21
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,000
construction of the Showhamm Project
has steadily progressed in orbit.

22
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,200
The Showhamm Project is an ambitious
endeavor to save the world,

23
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,680
by solving all of our energy needs.

24
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:12,080
We anticipate its completion to usher
in our advance into the next century.

25
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,120
Hey, haven't you ever seen them?

26
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,480
What do you mean by ''them''?

27
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,360
The Knight Sabers! They're so cool!

28
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,400
You mean you really believe that
''champions of justice'' actually exist?

29
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,960
It's a rumor, just a rumor.

30
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,400
But I used to watch them on the
net in my home town.

31
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,440
If they actually existed, the television
news would do a report on them.

32
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,960
I've never seen any news
reports on them.

33
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,480
Rumor? That's it?

34
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,720
I'm sorry to have kept you
waiting so long.

35
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,800
Oh, thanks!

36
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,960
Thank you very much.

37
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,120
Somehow, I can't help hating boomers.

38
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,080
I don't see why they have to
look like humans.

39
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,160
They could look like robots,
couldn't they?

40
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,840
I think it's supposed to make it easier
for us to be friendly with them.

41
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,320
Oh boy, you're a klutz, aren't you?

42
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,520
Do you want to go back, and
get another sandwich.

43
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,400
Hold it right there!

44
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,920
Hey, stop it!

45
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,480
What are you going to do
about my lunch?

46
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,680
Linna, cut it out! She didn't hit you!

47
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,280
You should pay for it.
Pay me back for my lunch!

48
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,000
Oh, no.

49
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,680
What is it?

50
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,040
You shouldn't get involved
with someone like that.

51
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,240
Tokyo isn't the little town
where you grew up.

52
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,160
I won't forgive her!

53
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,360
Linna, don't be late, okay?

54
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,080
Damn, it's difficult to run
with these shoes on!

55
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,440
I won't endure an insult like this
the minute I move to Tokyo!

56
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,000
Running away?

57
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,320
Where is your shoe?

58
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,960
You can't work looking like that.

59
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,560
Your makeup is a mess as well.

60
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,520
You can't see customers like that.

61
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,880
I think I'm starting to dislike boomers.

62
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,840
I'm a boomer, but I have a responsibility
to educate new employees.

63
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,440
Such statements will affect
your assessment,

64
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,280
so you should avoid saying
things like that.

65
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,800
Yes, yes.

66
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,120
One yes is enough.

67
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,120
Yes, yes, yes!

68
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,720
Damn it! Why me?

69
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,240
Why do I have to be ordered
around by a boomer?

70
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,320
Is that the brave new employee
in the Second Sales Division?

71
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,440
Yes, my name is Linna Yamazaki.

72
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,480
I heard you're new to Tokyo?

73
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,160
Yes, I am. I thought I knew enough about
Tokyo from watching television,

74
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,120
but now that I'm living here, it
seems completely different!

75
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,040
Well, shall I give you a little
tour of the city tonight?

76
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,760
What? Where?

77
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,360
There are lots of interesting
places in Megalocity.

78
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,480
This is Bravo Tango. Situation normal.

79
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,440
Bravo Tango, roger. Return to tower.

80
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Nothing to do again today.

81
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,520
We haven't had any mad boomer
incidents recently, have we?

82
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,960
We'd be in trouble if they happened
too often, but it's been so slow,

83
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,960
I've started thinking about
finding another job.

84
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,440
What kind of job do you want, Nene?

85
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,240
Well, I want to be more
active physically.

86
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,200
For example?

87
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,480
For example...

88
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,680
Knight Sabers!

89
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,680
Or something like that.

90
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,040
Are you an idiot?

91
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,320
Totem Pole, can you hear me?

92
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,560
This is the AD Police Intelligence
Agency, Management Center.

93
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,880
Next time you call here with a weird
nickname, I won't answer, Leon-chan!

94
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,160
Leon-chan, is it?

95
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,640
I haven't sunk so low that eighteen year
old girls can give me nicknames.

96
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,160
There are no mad boomers
in Sodo Ward today.

97
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,480
Roger. It's quitting time,
so I'm going home.

98
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,200
She acts like a part timer, doesn't she?

99
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,720
We're supposed to be a SWAT team.

100
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,280
Instead we're just a clean up
team for boomer messes.

101
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:20,240
Not to mention the obnoxious people
who take even those away from us.

102
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,760
Just thinking about them drives me mad.

103
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,080
Damn those Knight Sabers!

104
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,040
After sinking during the earthquake,

105
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,080
this area was beneath the attention
of city planners.

106
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,560
But it was also the first area
to recover: Sodo Ward.

107
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,880
It's incredible, isn't it?

108
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,720
This is where the desires
of adults are fulfilled.

109
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,320
No matter what your desire,

110
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,520
if you want it bad enough, it can
happen, but it'll cost you.

111
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,760
Really? That's a little scary.

112
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Uh, boss?

113
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,720
We're not in the office, so
you can call me Kane.

114
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:07,240
Have you heard of those champions who
appear when a boomer goes berserk?

115
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,520
Knight something, you mean?
They're annoying!

116
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,360
They do a lot of damage to
our company image,

117
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,360
since we're involved with the
boomer industry.

118
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,360
It's just not possible for boomers
to go berserk.

119
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,960
But, should something happen,
there's the AD Police.

120
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,800
I consider them to be a dangerous
vigilante group.

121
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,160
Are you one of their stupid fans?

122
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,160
I...

123
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,400
That woman...

124
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,640
Well, why don't we stop talking
about work tonight?

125
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,560
Let's have fun.

126
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,440
Lady Sylia, please come to the pit.
We've confirmed the reaction.

127
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,280
What's this? You have an injury here.

128
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,680
Oh, I had a small fall.

129
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,960
You need to take good care of your face.

130
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,440
Excuse me, but what time do you have?

131
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,680
It's hard to tell at night since we can't
see the shadow of the sky hook.

132
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,720
You live by yourself, don't you?

133
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,360
Don't you think it's rude to worry about
when it's time to go home?

134
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,520
I'm sorry!

135
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,760
Why am I apologizing to him?

136
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,880
Geez, what bad timing this is!

137
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,840
It's here!

138
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,520
Excuse me, I'm going home!

139
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,800
What's wrong? The night will
last a long time, and well...

140
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,000
And well what?

141
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,040
You know, I'm in charge of the
assessment of new employees.

142
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,320
Keep in mind that your position will be
affected by what I tell the chief.

143
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,200
So, you're the supervisor who gets
a feel for new employees?

144
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,520
What did you say?

145
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,920
A mad boomer?!

146
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,000
Boss?!

147
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,160
Get out of my way!

148
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,080
What a jerk!

149
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,560
Is there an AD Fronter near Sodo Ward?

150
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,600
This is Leon.

151
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,680
There's a mad boomer at Pace
Brook in Sodo Ward.

152
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,760
We have a request from the
regular police to dispatch.

153
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,400
We have to go back there,
don't we? Geez...

154
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,640
Why the hell are you upset?!

155
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,200
I don't want them to get there
ahead of us again!

156
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,800
There's an exit over there!

157
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,920
Why do you have to be chasing me?!

158
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,840
Let's play! Hey, let's
clean up and play!

159
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,800
Oh, no! Hurry up, Priss, let's go.

160
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,560
Don't be so much trouble.

161
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,600
You already checked your
self-starter, didn't you?

162
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,920
Pay attention to each other's gauge
at all times! Do you understand?

163
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,440
I heard already!

164
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,840
I've got it on. I'm going.

165
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,640
Destroy it, completely!

166
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,000
Why do you have to target me?!

167
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,800
Oh, no!

168
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,160
Knight Sabers!

169
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,080
No way! Are you saying I have to jump?!

170
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,240
Hey! Wait a second!

171
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,360
Oh, God. All right!

172
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,240
Leon, we're late. Again.

173
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,400
Damn!

174
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,240
Yet another peaceful morning
dawns in Megalocity.

175
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:57,040
Citizens, please give thanks that you're
able to live in such a peaceful city.

176
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,840
This program is presented by the Genom
Corp., the leaders in boomer technology.

177
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,640
That's all of my report.

178
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,880
See you at the usual meeting next week.

179
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,640
Hi, it was rough last night, wasn't it?

180
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,280
I looked for you. Anyway,
I'm glad you're okay.

181
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,160
Thank you for everything last night.

182
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,200
Thank goodness you're okay!

183
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,880
I would like to express my
appreciation to you, so...

184
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,720
Well, tonight, perhaps?

185
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,480
No, I'd like to do it right now.

186
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,560
This is my appreciation!

187
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,840
Priss, why don't you have
a drink tonight?

188
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,400
Next time.

189
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:49,960
Damn, you say that all the time!
Next time.

190
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,640
Damn, you say that all the time!

191
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:59,880
Thanks anyway! You were
great as always tonight!

192
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,920
Who's there?

193
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,480
What are you going to do about my scar?

194
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,000
It will heal soon.

195
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,560
You're a Knight Saber, aren't you?

196
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,600
I want to be a Knight Saber too.

197
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,080
Wait!

198
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,280
I want to be a member of
the Knight Sabers.

199
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,080
Even though it's been beyond my grasp,
I've been longing for it.

200
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,240
But now the opportunity is right in
front of me, so I'll do my best!

201
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,480
I was able to meet Priss, but
she ran away from me.

202
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,160
I chased her, but lost her after awhile.

203
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,160
The next thing I found was...
What a surprise!

204
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,320
Next Bubblegum Crisis!
